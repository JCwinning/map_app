# Product Guidelines - Shop Map Manager

## Voice and Tone
- **Friendly and Personal:** The interface should feel like a personal digital journal. Use welcoming language (e.g., "Welcome back! Where are we going today?" or "Save your favorite spots").
- **Clear and Direct:** Despite the friendly tone, instructions and actions should be easy to understand.

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Modern & Flat Design:** Adhere to a clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by modern design frameworks like Material Design.
- **Map Focus:** The map is the primary workspace. Keep UI overlays (sidebars, popups) unobtrusive.
- **Color-Coding Logic:**
    - **Visited:** Red
    - **Want to Visit:** Green
- **Icons:** Use simple, flat icons for categories to ensure they remain legible even at small zoom levels on the map.

## Data Organization
- **Flat Categorization:** Use a simple, single-level list of categories (tags) to make selection and filtering quick and intuitive.
- **Unstructured Reflection:** Prioritize large, free-form text areas for personal notes to allow users to record their thoughts without constraint.

## Search Interaction
- **Autocomplete-first:** When using the Gaode API, provide immediate feedback as the user types to make finding shops effortless.
